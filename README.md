# Password-Generator

## Description

For most people, it is very difficult to keep thier information secure online. I wanted to create a place where people can give the criteria they would like to use and the computer would choose a random password for them to use. This site will help people create a secure, random password to use. In making this project I grew my knowledge of JavaScript, and problem solving.

## Usage

This can be used to create random passwords. The user will be able to put in the number of character they would like and what kind of character that are needed for their password (such as uppercase letters or special characters). There are also fault checks to help the user, so If they choose a number under 8 or over 128 for the length of the password, the computer will ask for another number. Also, If the user sayd that they do not want any of the types of characters available, the computer will tell the user that they need to choose at least 1 of the types of characters.
